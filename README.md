# GoPersistKV: A Persistent Key-Value Store Engine in Golang

GoPersistKV is a simple, yet powerful, persistent key-value store engine written in Golang. It incorporates various features to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.

## Features

### 1. Caching

GoPersistKV includes an intelligent caching mechanism to enhance read performance. By caching frequently accessed keys and values in-memory, it significantly reduces the need to access the underlying storage for repeated requests.

### 2. SST Files Compaction

To optimize storage space and improve read/write performance, GoPersistKV utilizes Sorted String Tables (SST) file compaction. This process consolidates and organizes data, reducing file fragmentation and enhancing overall system efficiency.

### 3. Goroutines and Concurrency

GoPersistKV leverages Goroutines and concurrency to handle multiple read and write operations concurrently. This ensures high throughput and responsiveness, making the engine suitable for applications with varying levels of workload.

### 4. Scalability

Designed with scalability in mind, GoPersistKV can efficiently scale to accommodate growing data volumes. The engine gracefully handles increased loads by distributing tasks across multiple Goroutines, making it suitable for both small-scale projects and large-scale applications.

### 5. Code Cleanness and Small Logic Blocks

GoPersistKV's codebase is clean, modular, and follows best practices for Golang development. The use of small logic blocks enhances readability and maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand, extend, and contribute to the project.

### 6. Simplicity

The design philosophy of GoPersistKV revolves around simplicity. The key-value store is easy to use, with a straightforward API that allows developers to interact with the engine seamlessly. The simplicity of the codebase facilitates rapid integration into various projects.

### 7. Fault Tolerance

GoPersistKV incorporates fault-tolerant mechanisms to handle unexpected errors or crashes gracefully. The engine employs techniques like data persistence and log-based recovery to ensure data integrity even in the face of unforeseen events.
